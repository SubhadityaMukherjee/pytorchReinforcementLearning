# pytorch Reinforcement Learning Tutorials
 -----

- Easy to understand RL codes. (Unlike most repos out there -.-)
- An attempt to learn RL
- I will as usual try to standardize/structure the code as I go along. Because it annoys me to look at horribly structured code which makes no sense.

## What functions are where? 
- A handy functions.png is provided in each repository to visualize which functions are present in which files
- Generated using my library [functionFinder](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/functionFinder)

## What do I need?
- Not much, just numpy, openai gym and eventually Pytorch
- And motivation of course

## Why another repo?

- COMMENTS!!
- I get there are a million repos already. I intend to draw from many sources and keep the codes a bit more organized and.. standardized
- Every repo/resource I learn from will be cited below if anyone wants to take a look

## Cites

- [PhilTabor](https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/) . This repo is awesome.
